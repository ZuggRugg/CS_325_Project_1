# Introduction

This is the first Project for CS-325, Utilzing two LLM's to read input text from a file and generate a response.

I used Python 3.13.2 and the most up to date version of the Transformers module for Python, for the library that Transformers utilize's I chose Pytorch


# Requirements

Download the requirements.yaml and install for an environment of your choosing using Venv or Miniconda 

```python3
pip install requirements.yaml
```
then to compile go over to the working directory and use the command

```python3
python Program.py
```

# Misc / Explanation

The two Large Language Models I chose were GPT2 and Ollama

If you're running this on smaller laptops its possible that you might get a memory error, If that is the case then
your computer might not be able to run the modle. The GPT2 model should only need <1 GB of RAM
