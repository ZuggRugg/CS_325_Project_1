* basic ideas

I need the Python Transformers package to access small NPM models
maybe also accellerate as well to use LLM's

https://huggingface.co/transformers/v4.7.0/task_summary.html
later versions have more models and better documentation, I just need to find it. 


need to familiarize myself with Python OOP concepts

functions to read input.txt into a list that holds string then iterates
sends to output array and prints to screen.

function to save data, etc, have it all in class format with inheritance ect.

** class structure

Load_data (reads data from an input file and sorts into list)

Save_data (saves responses into list and then output file, ect.)

Models
